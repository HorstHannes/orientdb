While using this tutorial onto Ubuntu 14.04
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-orientdb-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps

cd ../releases/orientdb*
---> orientdb/graphdb/target/databases/GratefulDeadConcerts does not exist.
The database is not transfered and not in the OrientDb Folder

cd bin                      <-- found server.sh in the server/script folder
./server.sh &
---> Results in Error: Could not find or load main class com.orientechnologies.orient.server.OServerMain

The OServerMain.class is stored in
/orientdb/server
/orientdb/server/config
/orientdb/server/target/classes/com/orientechnologies/orient/server

The OServerMain.java is stored in
/orientdb/server/src/main/java/com/orientechnolgies/orient/server

So where is the Problem?

I reinstalled the whole Linux System and it is not workin even after following the tutorial for each step.
